	You can transfer funds from
	Canadian currency to a full range of currencies with a foreign currency money
	draft. Our money drafts, which are accepted for redemption worldwide, are
	issued and guaranteed by the Bank of America.
	
	The draft is prepaid at
	the time of purchase and is cashable upon receipt. The purchaser is responsible
	for delivering the draft to the recipient.
      
      
	There is a small service
	charge to buy a money draft, waived for Surrey Metro Savings
	PRESTIGE Chequing account holders.
	
	Consider a Foreign Currency
	Money Draft if:
	
	  
	    you need to pay for a purchase or service to a dealer in a country that would
	    not accept a standard Canadian bank cheque or cash.
	  
	    you want to send a gift to a friend or relative overseas and you are worried
	    about sending cash.
