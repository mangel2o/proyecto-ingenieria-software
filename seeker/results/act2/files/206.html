 Roelof T. Bruintjes: Ph. D.
Affiliate Professor

Research Interests: Cloud physics, mesoscale modeling, and weather 
modifications 

Dr. Bruintjes works on the improvement of microphysical parameterization in 
numerical cloud- and mesoscale models, evaluating cloud seeding efforts with 
numerical models, on the development of new cloud seeding techniques, and 
developing linked atmospheric/hydrological models to simulate the full 
hydrological cycle.
