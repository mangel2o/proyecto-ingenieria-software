Worn Shocks













Worn Shocks Can "Sneak Up" On You


Have you ever noticed how quickly you can become accustomed to an annoying
shake or rattle?  You may forget it's there until the condition becomes
serious.  Worn shock absorbers or struts are a classic example of the kind of
deterioration that warrants early attention.  The first indication of pending
failure of these critical parts is when the vehicle dives when brakes are
applied, sways on turns or "bottoms out" on a bumpy road.

A visual inspection under the car often discloses potential trouble, such as a
leaking or damaged shock or worn parts such as rubber bushings.

The Car Care Council warns that weak shocks and/or struts lead to poor ride
control which affects more than comfort:  it's a safety factor as well.
