"National Car Care Month" Press Kit
The 1996 National Car Care Month Press Kit, produced by the Car Care Council, is available 
now. National Car Care Month is a nationwide effort by businesses, civic groups, the government 
and the media to focus motorists' attention on the need to maintain and repair their cars. 
Although events are held throughout the year, October is an ideal time for motorists to get their 
cars ready before winter strikes. You can download the official Press Kit in PDF format from our 
Tips department.

TIPS From the Car Care Council
 As a standing feature of AUTOSHOP-Online, we provide a series of FREE 
autocare hints for owners of all types of vehicles.  Now we've teamed up with 
the Car Care Council, the most widely respected source of automotive information 
in North America, to bring you an ever-expanding library of free information 
regarding preventive maintenance, fuel conservation and the safe operation 
of motor vehicles.

AUTO 101
 Announcing the arrival of our comprehensive, FREE 
automotive information service, which we call AUTO 101.  Through our partnership with 
a publisher of automotive educational materials, you are now able to explore the 
complexities of the modern automobile and all of its major mechanical and 
electrical systems, right here at AUTOSHOP-Online.  It's just like having a mechanic 
in the family.


HOT LINK
The Automotive Service Association (ASA) has launched a new site dedicated 
to assisting consumers and automotive service professionals. ASA is an 
international organization made up of approximately 12,000 member-businesses 
that work to deliver excellence in mechanical, collision and transmission service 
to consumers.

Features on the growing site include the online version of AutoInc., the official 
publication of ASA, and a shop locator, directing consumers to a nearby ASA member 
shop that provides the services they need.

Visitors to the site will also find general Automotive Tips and Consumer Research. 
And a little digging uncovers insider tips to service technicians, and detailed articles 
of interest to those working on cars, whether professionally or at home.


RECALLS
From time to time, the United States National Highway Transportation Safety
Administration (NHTSA) publishes automotive safety notices. This information is
available by make and model, by calling the Department of Transportation Auto
Safety Hotline at 800.424.9393. ("The Hotline operates from 8 am to 10 pm
Eastern Time, Monday thru Friday. Calls can be received during non-business
hours by means of a sophisticated automatic telephone answering service.")

This information is also available by publication date on the WWW. Use this link 
to go directly to the NHTSA 
safety recall notices.
