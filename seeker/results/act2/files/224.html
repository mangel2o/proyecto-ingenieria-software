Our company owns a Mitsubishi industrial micro-robotmodel RV-M2. I have encountered problem of c program interface with the robot via RS 232 serial port. the Cfunction format used to send to the robot is   fputs("string of robot commands",stdaux); but alwaysreceived no respond from the robot, can anyone up in the cyber space tell me why? Thanks, regards.
