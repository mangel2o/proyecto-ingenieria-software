Committee to Protect Journalists Introduces World Wide Web site on World Press Freedom Day

New Service Allows Easy Access to Information on Cases, Countries, Publications, News Alerts

NEW YORK---The Committee to Protect Journalists, the U.S.-based press freedom advocacy organization, will go on line with its World Wide Web site on May 3, World Press Freedom Day. CPJ&#146;s new Web site is located at http://www.cpj.org. 

"CPJ&#146;s Web site will provide vital news and information and serve as an advocacy tool," said William A. Orme, Jr., CPJ&#146;s executive director. 

"Our World Wide Web site will give reporters and activists around the world immediate access to CPJ&#146;s most recent information and its vast archived database about press freedom violations," Orme continued. "For journalists living in countries where press restrictions are most severe, access to CPJ&#146;s Web site will provide essential information and assistance."

CPJ&#146;s Web site will enable journalists, policy-makers, press freedom activists, and others to quickly access information about press freedom violations in more than 100 countries, hundreds of individual cases, and safety information about dangerous assignments worldwide.

CPJ&#146;s site will include several components:


News Alerts: Up-to-date information about press freedom violations around the world.
Urgent Case Alerts: Each month, CPJ will highlight an urgent press freedom violation case. 
SafetyNet: Practical information and safety tips for reporters on dangerous assignments, from correspondents worldwide and CPJ&#146;s research.
 Press Freedom Database: A regularly updated, searchable database, featuring verified reports of journalists killed, imprisoned, or attacked in more than 100 countries, plus an archive of past CPJ investigations and actions.
 Publications: Access to CPJ&#146;s most recent publications, including its worldwide survey Attacks on the Press in 1995, released in March 1996.
Membership: Applications for membership in CPJ.
