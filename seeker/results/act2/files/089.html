PC Special Edition






Where is the software?


All the software is located, naturally enough, in the Software 
directory at the top level of the CD directory.  


How is the software organized?

It's organized by software package, each having it's own 
directory containing the application and associated files.  

In the Main group, run the File Manager.
Go to the CD and browse the Software directory.  
You'll see few directories and/or files. 
Let's briefly go over what each software package does:
