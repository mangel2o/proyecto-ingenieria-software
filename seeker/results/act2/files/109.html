Cooling System Tuneup Checklist













Cooling System

"Tune-up" Checklist

Flush dirt, bugs and leaves from front of radiator with a brush and garden
hose.
Inspect the radiator cap.  Replace it if the rubber gasket is broken, dried
out or missing.
Check the condition and level of coolant.  If it is rusty, clean the system
and replace with a 50/50 mixture of water and ethylene glycol anti-freeze.
Inspect radiator and radiator hoses for leaks, cracks or soft, mushy
condition.  Tighten all clamps.  Replace hoses as needed.
Look for the heater hose running from the engine, through the firewall, to
the heater core under the dash.  Replace swollen or cracked hoses.  To check
the hoses, start the engine and turn on the heater.  If after ten minutes the
hoses are cool, they could be clogged.
Inspect all engine belts for wear and cracks.  Replace if worn, cracked or
glazed.  Adjust loose belts.  Note:  Some engines have a V-ribbed belt that
drives some or all of the accessories.  If the belt grooves show excessive
cracks or "chunking", replace the belt.
Check the thermostat operation by running the engine for 10-15 minutes.
Generally, it's OK if you can feel warm coolant surging through the upper hose.
Beware of an engine that runs too hot or too cool.  Tighten loose bolts on the
thermostat housing at the engine.
Clean the engine exterior.  Excessive oil and dirt will hide leaks, or
insulate the engine, causing it to run hot.
