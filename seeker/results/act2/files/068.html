AESOP DS 








AESOP 1000 Development System (DS)




Product Overview


The AESOP 1000 DS has been designed to provide a robotic development
platform for research applications. This system allows all of
the command modes of the standard AESOP 1000 System, but also
adds the flexibility of PC communication directly with the AESOP
Controller. The flexibility of the DS System allows a platform
for building new robotic applications and laparoscopic research.



System Usage


The DS System, like the AESOP 1000, is intended for use in a laparoscopic
setting where the robot's end effector is attached to a fixed-pivot
laparoscope. The DS System is not intended for clinical use and
requires a PC connection to function. The user is provided with
a disk containing the AESOP System software, a file transfer program,
and a library of movement and data collection routines.


To use the System, AESOP is connected to the PC through the serial
port. The file transfer software is loaded on the PC and the System
software can then be loaded through the serial port. Once this
is done, the System can be used within the standard AESOP command
modes (e.g. using the Foot and Hand Controls, Manual Mode, and
memory positions). The user can also send and receive additional
data from the PC through the serial port.


Research Applications


With the serial port, users can send data to and receive data
from the AESOP System. A library of commands is provided on a
floppy disk. For example, the robot's individual joints can be
commanded to move to specific locations. The system can send back
information about joint positions and movement histories. 


In addition, other interfaces may be used to control the
robot. For example, the robot could be moved through voice commands,
head tracking or any other directional input signals.
