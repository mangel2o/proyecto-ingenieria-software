Keep Car Cool
Summer heat is hard on a car's interior.  It can cause the headliner (ceiling
fabric) to droop, the padded dash to crack and upholstery to fade.

Many summer related problems can be addressed with a little common sense.  Try
to park in the shade.  Avoid those wide open spaces that allow relentless full
time exposure to the sun.

Try to park near a building to assure your car of some shade at least part of
the time.

Finally, purchase a sun shade.  These inexpensive cardboard blockers placed in
the windshield and rear windows help lower the interior temperature.

More tips on protecting your car's interior are in a free pamphlet, `HOW TO
KEEP YOUR CAR LOOKING YOUNG', published by the Car Care Council.  Send a
stamped, self addressed envelope to the Car Care Council, Dept. N, One Grande
Lake Drive, Port Clinton, OH  43452.
