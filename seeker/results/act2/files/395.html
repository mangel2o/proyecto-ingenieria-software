Bar Associations 
Bar associations are professional groups for attorneys. Bar associations view helping the public as an important part of their mission. The largest bar association in Illinois is the Illinois State Bar Association (ISBA). Each member of the ISBA may also belong to one of the 11 local bar associations. These associations serve their members by providing continuing legal education and a forum for discussing concerns of the legal profession. They also serve the public, providing lawyer referrals, informational booklets and pamphlets, telephone information services, and a variety of public education programs. Most of these services are available at little or no cost. 
Members of the public should consider taking advantage of bar association services when they are seeking general information. Although they cannot provide legal advice, bar associations can help people decide whether to pursue a case, what actions to take, and what type of lawyer to contact. A list of bar associations and bar association referral services appear later in this appendix. 
The following pamphlets were prepared and published by the Illinois State Bar Association as a public service. Their purpose is to inform citizens of their legal rights and obligations. Consult your lawyer if you have questions about application of the law in a particular case.
Single copies of each of the pamphlets are free to individuals. Spanish language translations are also available. For information on obtaining quantity copies, write or call the ISBA at the following:

Attorney General's Office 
Attorney General Jim Ryan serves the citizens of Illinois as the State's chief law officer and top legal official. Charged with these responsibilities, the Attorney General directs a broad range of services dedicated to protecting and assisting the State and its citizens.
As Illinois' chief law enforcement official, Attorney General Jim Ryan leads the statewide fight against crime and violence. He assists local State's Attorneys in the prosecution of major crimes, and heads the Statewide Grand Jury, which indicts and convicts drug dealers and gun runners whose operations cross county lines.
As Illinois' top legal official, Attorney General Jim Ryan prosecutes perpetrators of consumer fraud, enforces environmental laws and regulations, and advocates on behalf of the state's citizens whose interests might otherwise go unheard.

Key Divisions in the Office of the Attorney General and Their Missions 
The Office of the Attorney General provides services that cover a broad range of issues, reaching every corner of Illinois.
The Criminal Justice Division helps local State's Attorney's prosecute death penalty cases and other major crimes.
To help put sophisticated criminal operations out of business, the Statewide Grand Jury is charged with prosecuting multi-county drug trafficking and gun running cases.
The Victim Compensation/Grants Bureau takes court costs imposed on convicted defendants and uses the money to help fight crime. The bureau distributes millions of dollars each year in grants to local crime-fighting organizations. The Bureau's Victim Compensation Program provides financial help directly to crime victims.
The Consumer Protection Division protects consumers and small businesses who have been victimized by fraud, deception or unfair competition. The Attorney General is a leader in fighting the emerging menace of telecommunications fraud. A network of regional offices throughout Illinois gives citizens immediate access to these services.
The Environmental Enforcement Division protects the health, safety and welfare of citizens through prosecution of environmental laws and regulations.
To serve those whose voices might not otherwise be heard, the Legal Advocacy Division provides information and referral services for seniors, veterans, women and children, disabled citizens, and agricultural advocacy groups.
The Public Interest Division protects Illinois citizens in cases involving civil rights, nursing homes, public utilities, charities, and antitrust violations.
The Attorney General is the lawyer for state government. The Appeals/Opinions and Government Representation Divisions act as the attorney for state agencies and officers.

As lawyers have grown increasingly concerned about their public image, they have also expanded their efforts to reach out to the public and provide helpful services to consumers. Free information, referrals, and a variety of educational programs are only a telephone call away. Consumers seeking information would be wise to make that call as one of their first steps in pursuing a legal matter.
