United States Flag Sailing School Vessels 
Westward and Corwith Cramer



The SSV Westward and SSV Corwith Cramer fly the U.S. flag and
are inspected and certificated by the U.S. Coast Guard as Sailing
School Vessels. They are required to meet safety standards that
differ from those of a passenger vessel on a comparable route.
Both ships meet or exceed all the safety requirements for their class. For 
operational safety, they are fully equipped with modern navigational
equipment.

The Cramer was the first vessel built using the U.S. Coast Guard's
regulations for Sailing School Vessels.
