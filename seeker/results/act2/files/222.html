New CPJ Report Finds Record 182 Journalists Imprisoned Worldwide
For Second Consecutive Year, Turkey Is Biggest Offender With 51 Jailed Journalists; 
Ethiopia (31), China (20) and Kuwait (18) Also Top List of 22 Countries  

WASHINGTON, D.C.--A record 182 journalists were in prison in 22 countries at the end 
of 1995, the Committee to Protect Journalists reported today in Attacks on the Press in 1995, its annual book-length survey of press freedom violations around the world. 

For the second consecutive year, Turkey held more journalists in jail (51) than any 
other country as the government continued to suppress independent reporting on the 
Kurdish conflict. The Committee to Protect Journalists today called on Prime Minister 
Mesut Yilmaz to release Turkey's imprisoned journalists and rescind the laws used to 
punish and censor the local press. 

"Turkey surpasses such totalitarian regimes as China and Syria in its willingness 
to throw journalists in jail," said CPJ Chair Kati Marton. "The new Turkish government 
should demonstrate its commitment to democracy by releasing our imprisoned colleagues 
and abolishing Article 8 of the Anti-Terror Law and Article 312 of the Penal Code, 
which are inherently incompatible with press freedom."

The number of confirmed cases of imprisoned journalists in 1995 exceeds CPJ's accounting 
for 1994 --a then-record 173 imprisoned journalists at year's end. The increase in 
1995 was largely attributable to the recent crackdown on independent journalism in 
Ethiopia and Nigeria. In each of the 182 cases documented in Attacks on the Press in 1995, CPJ staff researchers verified that the jailed journalists were imprisoned as a 
direct reprisal for their reporting and remained incarcerated on Dec. 31, 1995. 

"Imprisonment is a very effective form of censorship," said William A. Orme, Jr., 
CPJ's executive director.

Attacks on the Press in 1995
 documents that at year's end:

 At least 182 journalists were in jail, up from 173 in 1994;
 The four countries with the highest number of imprisoned journalists were Turkey 
(51), Ethiopia (31), China (20) and Kuwait (18);
 Vietnam, Peru, Myanmar (Burma) and Nigeria each held eight journalists in jail; 
and
 There were six jailed journalists in Syria, four in Indonesia and Algeria, and three 
in Zaire.


The Legal Tools Used to Imprison&nbsp;Journalists 
Though the political contexts of these imprisonments vary widely from country to country, 
the incarcerations of journalists fall into several broad categories. Some representative 
cases: 

Turkey: 
Isik Ocak Yurtcu, the editor of Ozgur Gundem, Turkey's leading pro-Kurdish daily, was imprisoned on Dec. 28, 1994. Charged under 
Article 8 of the Anti-Terror Law, he was convicted of publishing "separatist propaganda." 
He remains in prison, serving a 25-year sentence. Article 8 of the Anti-Terror 
Law defines nongovernmental accounts of the Kurdish conflict as proscribed propaganda; 
publishing such independent reports is a criminal offense. 

Turkey is the biggest offender in this category, but it is not unique: In Ethiopia 
and many other countries, journalists writing or broadcasting reports on civil war 
or ethnic strife are accused of violating broadly drafted hate speech laws, as if 
their reporting were the cause rather than a consequence of those conflicts.

Peru:
Eduardo Sihue Cano, a graphic artist for the left-wing magazine Cambio, was imprisoned 
on June 12, 1992, and sentenced to six years in prison for being an "apologist for 
terrorism," a crime under Peru's 1992 anti-terrorism legislation. Under Peruvian 
anti-terror laws, Sihue had no right to confront his accuser; his attorney could not 
review evidence beforehand or otherwise challenge the government's case; the judges 
were hooded ("faceless") security officials with limited legal training. Sihue remains 
in prison.

Again, Peru is not unique. Turkey, Kuwait, Algeria, China, Iran, Myanmar (Burma), Nigeria, 
Syria, Tunisia and Vietnam also consider the publication of news stories about armed 
insurgents a criminal violation of anti-terrorism laws. Special tribunals with unidentified accusers and anonymous judges are used by several other countries, including 
the United Kingdom, for prosecuting alleged terrorist offenses.

Ivory Coast (Cote D'Ivoire): 
Abou Drahamane Sangare and Emmanuel Kore, who work for the opposition daily La Voie, were imprisoned on Dec. 21, 1995, for suggesting in print that President Henri Konan 
Bedie's attendance at the African Champions Cup final brought bad luck to the losing 
national soccer team. The two were sentenced to two years in prison for "offending 
the chief of state." They remain in prison.

Turkey, Indonesia, Central African Republic, Iran, Myanmar (Burma) and Cameroon and 
many other countries use criminal libel and slander laws to imprison reporters who 
write unflattering stories about the president, elected officials, spiritual leaders 
and businessmen.


China:
 Gao Yu, a free-lance journalist from Hong Kong, was imprisoned on Oct. 2, 1993. 
She was tried without counsel and sentenced to six years in prison for "leaking state 
secrets" about China's structural reforms in articles for the pro-Beijing Hong Kong 
magazine Mirror Monthly.
She remains in prison.

Algeria, Vietnam and others rely on similarly arbitrary and vague definitions of national 
security and state secrets to imprison journalists.

Nigeria:
Nosa Igiebor, the editor in chief of Nigeria's Tell
 magazine, was imprisoned on Dec. 23, 1995. He was arrested by six members of the 
State Security Service at his home in Lagos. Authorities demanded that he reveal 
his sources for articles critical of the government and accused him of receiving 
financial support from "outsiders." Igiebor's arrest and detention were confirmed by numerous 
CPJ sources in Nigeria. Government authorities still deny that they have detained 
him, however. He has not been charged with any crime.

In Algeria, Iraq, Libya, Western Sahara, Zaire, Zambia and other countries, journalists 
are often jailed without charges. Authorities also often deny that they are holding 
these journalists in jail, which makes it difficult to confirm many cases of imprisoned journalists. 

Turkish Campaign Against Press Ensnares American Journalist
Almost all of the journalists prosecuted for these offenses are nationals working 
for local publications and broadcast outlets. One recent exception was Aliza Marcus, 
an American journalist working in Reuters' Istanbul bureau, who was charged in August 
1995 for allegedly contravening Article 312 of the Penal Code, which makes it a crime 
to "incite racial hatred." Marcus' real offense was reporting on the forced evacuation 
of Kurdish villages by the military. She faced up to three years in prison, even 
though the facts in her story were never contested. The charges against Marcus were dropped 
after her trial prompted protests from prominent foreign journalists, including CPJ 
Honorary Chairman Walter Cronkite, who discussed the case in Ankara with then-Prime Minister Tansu Ciller. 

"I believe international pressure made a big difference in my case, but Turkish journalists 
don't get the same level of international support," said Marcus, who is receiving 
a Freedom of the Press Award from the National Press Club in Washington today. Marcus has since left Turkey, forced out by the government's refusal to renew her press 
accreditation. She now works for Reuters in Cyprus. 

Special Reports and Information in CPJ's Attacks
 Report

Drawn from the firsthand research of CPJ's full-time professional staff, Attacks on the Press in 1995
is the single most authoritative and comprehensive assessment of the status of press 
freedom around the world today. CPJ's staff writers examine press freedom conflicts 
in more than 100 countries and offer detailed information on 720 cases of imprisonment, censorship, legal harassment and physical assaults on reporters, editors and broadcasters 
around the world. The book features insightful commentaries on the murders of journalists 
in Algeria and Russia, and examines broader press freedom crises in Nigeria, Cuba and Kashmir. Christian Science Monitor
 correspondent David Rohde writes of his ordeal as a prisoner of the Bosnian Serbs; 
Palestinian journalist Imad Musa discusses arbitrary detention and censorship under 
Arafat; Russian reporter Masha Gessen reports on homophobic attacks against gay and 
lesbian journalists in 14 countries over the past five years. 


Journalists Killed 1986--1995

For the first time, CPJ's annual report includes a complete list of all confirmed 
cases of journalists who have been killed in the line of duty in the past 10 years. 
More than 300 of these 456 confirmed deaths bore all the signs of deliberate political 
assassinations, CPJ reports. Few of these crimes have been prosecuted, however. 

The five countries with the highest death tolls over the past decade were Algeria, 
with 53 confirmed killings, all by radical Islamist terror factions; the former Yugoslavia, 
where at least 45 reporters were killed in cross fire and at the hands of assassins; Colombia, with 43 deaths, most in reprisal for coverage of drug trafficking; 
Tajikistan, where 29 journalists were killed, the victims of death squads and armed 
insurgents; and the Philippines, also with 29 dead, where journalists were targeted 
for exposing corruption during a rocky transition to democracy. 

As reported in January, CPJ's Attacks on the Press in 1995
 documents 51 cases of journalists murdered in the line of duty last year. Forty-five 
of these deaths were political assassinations, including the murders of 24 Algerian 
journalists, and six resulted from combat assignments.

The Committee to Protect Journalists documents and responds to press freedom abuses 
around the world. From its headquarters in New York, CPJ works to get detained journalists 
out of jail, directs international campaigns of protest against repressive governments and provides practical safety information to reporters assigned to dangerous 
areas. CPJ is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization financed wholly by donations 
from individuals, private foundations and news organizations.

The CPJ annual report was released today in Washington, D.C., at a press conference 
at the National Press Club. A World Wide Web edition of Attacks on the Press in 1995
 is available at http://www.cpj.org. To purchase a copy of the book, contact CPJ at
