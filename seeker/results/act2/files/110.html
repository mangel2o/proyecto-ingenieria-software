Interpretive Tree TrailsInterpretive Tree Trails   A series of well-graded walking trails traverses Arbor Day Farm's orchards, croplands, grasslands, and the oak-hickory forest along South Table Creek, a tributary of the nearby Missouri River, that crosses the property. These trails provide opportunities to enjoy trees in both their natural habitat as well as in orchards, windbreaks, tree plantations and other human-planted settings. Along the trails, you'll find unobtrusive interpretive panels that provide understanding of the trees, their environment, and the natural and aboricultural processes that are at work on the farm.
