	In the Open, Variable-Rate
	MetroMortgage, your interest rate will equal Prime and will vary as does
	Prime. Meanwhile, your monthly payment remains fixed for up to one year.
	When rates go down, a greater portion of your monthly payment is applied
	to the principal. Alternatively, when rates increase, a greater portion of
	your total payment is applied to the interest.
