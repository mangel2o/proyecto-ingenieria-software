Rain Forest RescueJoin us in saving the earth's most precious wildlands before it's too late!By supporting The National Arbor Day Foundation's Rain Forest Rescue Campaign, you'll be doing more for our planet and humanity than you likely realize. The extent of destruction already wrought by the burning and bulldozing of rain forest has reached such proportions that it now threatens worldwide consequences. More than 4,000 acres of this irreplaceable forest is being burned off each hour!Real Dangers to our Climate!The uncontrolled burning of the rain forest is pouring out carbon dioxide faster than surrounding forests can cleanse it from the air. The result: burning rain forest is a major contributor to the &quot;greenhouse effect&quot; now predicted by many scientists.The Loss of Tomorrow's Miracle Drugs!While occupying only two percent of the earth's surface, rain forests support well over half of our planet's wild plants, trees, animal and insect life -- including vegetation that provides a quarter of today's drugs and medicines, for the treatment of everything from heart disease to leukemia.Still, 99 percent of rain forest vegetation has yet to be evaluated for its possible medical value! Some 2,100 varieties of rain forest plants are known to possess cancer fighting properties. And no one knows how many other plants may do the same in the fight against cancer and other diseases.Burning the Answers to World Hunger!Without trees and plants, the delicate lands of the tropics quickly turn barren. Ironically, if left to science undisturbed, the life-nurturing rain forests of the world could help produce bumper crop yields worldwide. This is possible because scientists are learning how to interbreed our main food crops with their robust, disease-resistant rain forest relatives. Many rain forest plants also produce their own insect repellants -- harmless substances that may well hold the key to nonpoisonous insecticides.A Threat to Over Half the World's Wildlife!Rain forests are home to at least 50 percent of our planet's wild species, and hardly any can survive elsewhere. The loss among these species -- from the howler monkey and toucan to the gorilla and red eyed frog -- is skyrocketing as they are squeezed into ever decreasing space. You Can Help Stop the Burning!When you support the Foundation's Rain Forest Rescue program, your $10 donation will preserve a 2,500 square foot tract of threatened rain forest in your name. The National Arbor Day Foundation works with local governmants and environmental groups in Latin America to develop and put into effect conservation plans protecting the rain forest. An acre at a time, Rain Forest Rescue works to fight the destruction of the earth's precious tropical rain forests.When you contribute to Rain Forest Rescue, you will also receive a year's membership in The National Arbor Day Foundation.If your browser supports secure transactions and you have a credit card...Click Here for a Secure Electronic TransactionIf your browser does not support secure transactions or you want to send a check, money order or purchase order...Click Here for a Print Form
