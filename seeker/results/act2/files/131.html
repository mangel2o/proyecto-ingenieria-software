Principal-Component Statistical Studies


PCMDI has conducted exploratory studies of the potential usefulness of
various linear and nonlinear statistical methods for model/model and 
model/data intercomparisons. 

Sengupta and Boyle (1993) applied the technique of common principal 
components (CPCs) to identify similar modes among vertically averaged 
atmospheric temperature fields as observed by the Microwave Sounding 
Unit (MSU) on satellites, as simulated by the ECMWF global atmospheric
model, and as represented by ECMWF analyses (a combination of data and 
model). They concluded that the use of CPC is a potentially promising 
approach for rigorously identifying model/data and model/model 
similarities, especially when the analysis is restricted to regions 
(e.g., the equatorial Pacific) where a dominant mode of variability 
(e.g. the ENSO) is likely to occur.  

Sengupta and Boyle (1995) considered the relative merits of applying
nonlinear principal component analysis (NLPCA) based on auto-associative 
neural networks vs the more traditional linear analysis (PCA) to identify 
the dominant modes of precipitation variability over the U.S.  They found 
that NLPCA effected somewhat greater data reduction and that the leading 
nonlinear mode captured the seasonal cycle of precipitation more clearly 
than the leading linear mode.  They concluded that use of NLPCA should be 
considered especially when linear PCA fails to uncover physically 
meaningful patterns in climatological data analysis.
