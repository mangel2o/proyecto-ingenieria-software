MK WINS TWO AWARDS FROM ADAM OPEL AGFOR AUTOMOTIVE COMPLEXES IN POLAND AND THAILAND


               
     BOISE--Morrison Knudsen Corporation announced today that its 
Cleveland-based Engineering &amp; Construction Group has been awarded 
program-management services contracts by Adam Opel AG, R�sselsheim, 
Germany, for new metal fabrication and car assembly complexes to
be built in Poland and Thailand.
     Preliminary design of the facilities is underway, and completion of 
the projects is scheduled for late 1998 in Poland and early 1999 in 
Thailand. 
     Robert A. Tinstman, MK president and chief executive officer said, 
"We are delighted to again take MK's automotive expertise abroad to 
support our client's worldwide expansion."  The scope of services at both 
sites will be very similar since both projects include common systems
and equipment.  Program-management services for both project locations 
will be headquartered in MK's R�sselsheim office, along with fully staffed 
field offices in Poland and Thailand.
     Morrison Knudsen Corporation, founded in 1912, serves the world's 
industrial, heavy construction, environmental, mining, operations and 
maintenance, power,  and transportation markets as an engineer and 
constructor.
