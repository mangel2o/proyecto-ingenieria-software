On The Edge Mugs

A quick message about the OnTE mugs (of which I own the Rain of Walrus).
Disclaimer...I am not associated in any way with Mystic Images, I just like the mugs! =)

My name is Larry - owner of Mystic Images - a graphics
imprinting company - we have a licensing agreement with Atlas Games to
reproduce OnTE cards on mugs (coffee cups). These cups are being
produced with a print run of only 1000 each. The whole card is printed
on the mug and is left hand facing which means if you hold the mug in
your left hand the image faces you.

Right now we have 4 cards available:

	Rain of Walrus
	Koanhead
	Dr. Nussbaum
	Monique D'Aubaine

The price is $10.00 each.
Shipping is $3.00 for the first and $1.00 for aditional mugs.
 Soooo, if you ordered 4 mugs your cost would be $40 for mugs and $6.00 for
shipping. Get the idea?
