Lancaster County Solid Waste Management Authority
Lancaster, Pennsylvania

Every year, haulers bring more than 400,000 tons of  waste
to the Authority for processing and disposal.

For Lancaster County, solid waste management has traditionally posed a challenge to officials whose goal it has been to implement the best available technology thereby minimizing the impact waste has on the environment.

Today, as in the past, the Lancaster County Solid Waste Management Authority's Board of Directors and staff operate a waste management system founded on innovation reliability and efficiency.  Every facet of Authority operations has been designed and implemented to assure environmental safety and quality service to the community.  Click here for a history of the organization.
