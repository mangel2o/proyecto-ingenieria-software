THE ANTI-DEATH PENALTY PAGE



Welcome to the Irish Section's
ANTI-DEATH PENALTY PAGE
AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL OPPOSES THE DEATH PENALTY IN ALL CASES
AND WITHOUT RESERVATION



The time has come...
The time has come to abolish the Death Penalty world-wide.  The
case for abolition becomes more compelling with each passing year.

Nowhere has it been shown that the Death Penalty has any special
power to reduce crime or political violence.  In country after
country it is used disproportionately against the poor and against
racial and ethnic minorities.  It is often used as a tool of political
repression.  Its use is arbitrary and irrevocable.  It is imposed
and inflicted arbitrarily.  It is an irrevocable punishment, resulting
inevitably in the execution of people innocent of any crime. 
It is a violation of fundamental human rights.

Whatever purpose is cited, the idea that a government can justify
a punishment as cruel as death, conflicts with the very concept
of human rights.  The significance of human rights is precisely
that some means may never be used to protect society because their
use violates the very values which make society worth protecting.

There are 38 states in the US which have the Death Penalty,
along with the US Government and the US Military.  As part of the Irish
Section's fight against the Death Penalty there are four local
groups working on the State of Virginia, USA.  These are Group
34 (Dublin), the Limerick Group, the Schull Group and the Cork
Group.

And now for some information on Virginia, and its very strange laws:

Virginia currently has 57 inmates on Death Row.  It has executed
31 inmates since 1976, five of them in 1995.  Another two have
been executed this year already.  Eleven States in the US forbid
execution of the mentally retarded, Virginia is NOT
one of them.  The methods of execution in VA are Lethal Injection
or Electrocution by choice, with Electrocution by default.

THE CONTEMPORANEOUS OBJECTION RULE

The C.O.R. states that when an objection is not raised in the
original trial, it cannot be considered in a direct or later appeal.
EVERY state except Virginia waives the C.O.R. in
capital cases, by statute or by case law.  This rule bars Appeals
Courts from hearing about even blatant mistakes in the trial and
illegal procedures that can include jury selection, jury instructions,
evidence prevented or withheld, witness testimony, and any other
aspect of the trial.  These problems can, and do, affect the basic
fairness and constitutionality of the trial. The issue
not objected to at the first trial is barred, even if it shows
the innocence of a person on Death Row.

THE 21 DAY RULE

The 21 Day Rule states that new evidence discovered more than
21 days after the trial cannot be considered in State or Federal
Courts, even if the evidence could prove the innocence of a convicted
defendant. The 21 Day Rule has created a situation where
a person can be legally executed despite new evidence that he
is innocent.


Please protest against this continued barbarism.  Write to: 
Governor George Allen, General Assembly Building, Richmond,
Virginia, VA 232219, USA.
