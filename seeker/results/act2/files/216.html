 William D. Sellers: Ph. D.
 Professor Undergraduate Academic Advisor

Research Interests: Physical climatology and climate modeling 

Dr. Sellers wrote the first, and still one of the
only, textbooks on physical climatology and developed one of the first
numerical models of climate. He has seen both fields grow from small
beginnings to major research efforts that now exist throughout the world
in climate modeling and global change.
