Product Description

With AESOP you can maintain direct control of the video image while using both hands to cut, suture, and irrigate. With cost 
containment more important than ever, AESOP is as necessary in today's OR as the scope itself. 

 
AESOP extends your reach in the OR

Holding to your highest surgical standards just got a lot easier. The Automated Endoscopic System for Optimal Positioning 
(AESOP) gives you total, precise control of the video image during procedures, and frees your staff from the constraints of 
scope-holding. The first ever robotic laparoscope positioner, AESOP helps make procedures safer for your patient, more 
efficient for your hospital, and less tiring for you and your staff. In fact, AESOP has benefits that make it an absolute necessity in 
today's standard laparoscopic setup.

Get the Benefits of Superior Scope Positioning

Now you can position the scope exactly where, how and when you choose, as well as maintain a steady image, without 
constantly relaying commands to a scopeholding assistant. Adjustments are made with easy-to-use Foot or Hand Controls or

scope positioning for important operative sites.
