Quality health care is just as important abroad as it is at home, however, most private medical schemes offer cover abroad for short periods or not at all.

At MEDICUS we want to ensure that our clients can receive the medical care they need anywhere in the world.

To this end MEDICUS in association with Crispin Speers & Partners Ltd. (CSP) has developed a range of Private Medical Insurance and Travel Plans designed for short and long term periods spent abroad.  Whether you are planning to work abroad for a number of years or take occasional holidays MEDICUS  can cover you with an appropriate plan.

All MEDICUS overseas plans are arranged through CSP who are international Insurance and Reinsurance brokers specialising in overseas and niche market insurance.  Speciality Insurance programs require secure insurers who know and understand our business.  CSP are situated in the heart of the London Insurance Market and are well placed to negotiate with U.K. and International Insuarnce Companies in addition to certain Underwriters at Lloyds for the benefit of our clients.

All policies are underwritten by Lloyds.  Our client's contract is with Underwriters at Lloyds.
