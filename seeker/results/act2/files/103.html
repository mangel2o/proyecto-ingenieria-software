1996 Celebration AwardCELEBRATION AWARDLower Umpqua Tree Plant, Reedsport, OregonReedsport, Oregon, and surrounding communities held the 50th annual Lower Umpqua School Tree Plant on April 4th, 1995.  More than 350 fifth, sixth and seventh graders planted 7,000 trees.  Helping out were many old-timers from tree plantings past, including several who were in on the first one in 1946.  They continued  the oldest continually-running school treeplant in the United States.Throughout the program's 50 years, fifth through seventh graders of Reedsport, Gardiner, Elkton and Ash Valley schools have planted more than three quarters of a million trees.  The sites are marked by signs and located on various private and public ownerships, ranging from recently logged tracts to abandoned farmsteads and forest fire burn areas.Several "extra" community activities were held to commemorate the Golden Anniversary.&#128; A self-guided tour of past treeplant sites was created complete with a map and brochure.&#128; The original tree planting site was rededicated with a beautiful new sign.&#128; A community Open House was held to gather past tree planters and others in the community.&#128; Displays at the Umpqua Discovery Center featured memorabilia, educational materials.&#128; And plans were developed for a memory book to be given to students and involved community members.A third generation of young tree planters is now participating in the event and the values which it represents are even more vital now than ever.  For the wise truths of its tradition, the National Arbor Day Foundation awards its 1996 Arbor Day Celebration Award to the Lower Umpqua School Tree Plant of Reedsport, Oregon.
