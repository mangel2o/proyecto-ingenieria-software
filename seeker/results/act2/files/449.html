Subject: Re: US Intelligence in the Indian subcontinent

An open question for all. I am interested in any information available
on CIA and other US intel agency operations in INDONESIA.

All kind of data would be greatly appreciated, as would any information
on specific cases on US intelligence involvement in the area.

Or if anyone have any links about it,just let me know.

Best
