	You can search our archives of thousands of NEWS.COM stories

Tips:

You can search for the text of a story, the author, or the title.

Separate search terms with commas.

You can also use AND and OR for more complex searches.
"Netscape AND Apple" will give you all stories that mention both companies.
"Netscape OR Apple" will give you all stories that mention one company, the
other, or both.

You can combine AND and OR for more complex searches. "Netscape AND Apple
OR Netscape AND IBM" will give you stories that mention Netscape and either IBM
or Apple.

You can also use NOT to eliminate stories from your search.  "Apple AND NOT
Microsoft" will
list stories about Apple Computer that don't mention Microsoft.
