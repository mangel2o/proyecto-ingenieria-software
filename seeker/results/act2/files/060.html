COMPUTER MOTION LAUNCHES AESOP 2000 
WORLD�S FIRST FDA CLEARED SURGICAL ROBOT CAPABLE
OF UNDERSTANDING VOICE COMMANDS IS NOW AVAILABLE

San Francisco, CA, October 7, 1996 -- At the American College of Surgeons 82nd
 Clinical Congress, Computer Motion, the world�s leading supplier of medical robots, 
announced the release of its next generation surgical robot -- AESOP 2000 with Voice Control.  
AESOP 2000 features the most intuitive interface available, the ability to understand a 
surgeon�s voice commands.  This allows the surgeon to use spoken English to precisely maneuver 
and position a laparoscope (a specially designed optical tube which, when connected to a 
medical video camera and light source, is passed into the body to allow the surgeon to view 
the operation on a video monitor).

AESOP 2000 (pronounced "eesop") is the second generation of the company�s flagship 
product, and was cleared by the FDA in May 1996.  A clinical advisory team comprised 
of leading endoscopic surgeons has worked closely with the company throughout the 
development of the surgical robot�s voice control interface.  Clinical validations have
 been successfully completed at over 15 institutions across the nation.

"Surgeons have been asking for an easy way to control their field of vision 
during surgery.  Our research has confirmed that voice control is the ideal interface.  
We are delighted to offer this advanced solution today," said Gene Wang, CEO & President 
of Computer Motion.  "We plan to apply our voice control technology across a broad range 
of surgical devices to create an industry standard surgeon-to-machine interface for the 
operating room."

AESOP (an acronym for Automated Endoscopic System for Optimal Positioning) was 
first introduced in October 1994.  Over 15,000 minimally invasive surgeries have 
been successfully assisted by AESOP in over 150 hospitals and surgery centers around 
the world.

"I love it [AESOP 2000]!" said Dr. Carlos Gracia, a leading endoscopic surgeon at 
San Ramon Regional Medical Center, San Ramon, CA.  "It�s quiet, it does what you tell 
it to do, it doesn�t complain, it doesn�t fatigue and has a precision that I can�t even 
duplicate when I�m holding the camera for someone else."

Computer Motion�s core development team, led by Chief Technical Officer and 
Founder, Dr. Yulun Wang, has worked together for over ten years and holds several 
key patents in robotics for medical applications.  Computer Motion is currently 
developing robotic and computer enhanced devices for new surgical applications which 
leverage the core technologies underlying the AESOP family of products.

Founded in 1989, Computer Motion is the world leader in medical robotics.  The 
company�s mission is to enhance surgeons� capabilities and improve outcomes while 
reducing costs in the operating room using computers and robotics.  Computer Motion 
is privately held and is based in Goleta, CA. The company�s Web site is
