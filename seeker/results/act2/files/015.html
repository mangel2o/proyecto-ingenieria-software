 Our study focuses on the use of SAR to study windblown processes
including sand and dust storms.  We are using SAR to estimate the
aerodynamic properties of a surface -- this is an important parameter
in climate modeling, the threshold windspeed for sand and dust
transport and other boundary layer models.  For further information
