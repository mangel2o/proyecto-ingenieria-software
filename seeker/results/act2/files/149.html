	Surrey Metro Savings offers
	money orders in Canadian funds. These money orders are acceptable only in
	Canada.
	
	The money order is prepaid
	at the time of purchase and is cashable upon receipt. The purchaser is
	responsible for delivering the money order to the recipient.
      
      
	There is a small service
	charge to buy a money order, waived for Surrey Metro Savings
	PRESTIGE Chequing account holders.
	
	Consider a Money Order if:
	
	  
	    you need to pay for a purchase or service to a dealer in Canada who would
	    not accept a standard Canadian bank cheque or cash.
	  
	    you want to send a gift to a friend or relative in Canada and you are worried
	    about sending cash.
