constitutional amendment to balance the budget by the year 2002 or two years after ratification by
the states.

2.  PUSH-BUTTON STRIKES.  Motion to invoke cloture (thus allowing the measure to be voted
on) on the Kassebaum amendment to block the implementation of a presidential executive order

6.  WELFARE FOR POLITICIANS.  Kerry amendment to strike from the budget resolution the
provisions that eliminate the Presidential Campaign Fund that is supported by a check-off on tax
returns.  [Under current law, major party candidates for president are supported by taxpayer
funds.  The Senate GOP budget resolution would have ended that.  The Kerry amendment sought
to continue taxpayer funding of presidential campaigns.]

7.  DEATH PENALTY DELAYS.  
Kyl amendment to prohibit federal habeas corpus appeals in state cases if a state has adequate and effective remedies to test the legality of the individual's detention.
