	A Mutual Fund is a pool
	of money invested by a professional manager in several investment vehicles,
	which may include stocks and bonds. The rates of return vary from one mutual
	fund to the next, as does the degree of risk. If these investments earn a
	profit, you share in that profit. Mutual Funds are eligible RRSP/RRIF investments
	and can also be held within a Self-Directed RRSP/RRIF.
      
      
	Consider this RRSP/RRIF
	option if:
	
	  
	    you hope to earn a better return than what you would earn on term deposits.
	  
	    you want to diversify your RRSP portfolio.
	  
	    you want to maximize your foreign content (up to 20%).
