Part 1. The IBM Software Servers

Chapter 1. Introducing IBM&#39;s Software Servers

Congratulations on choosing the
IBM Internet Connection Secure Server for OS/2 Warp.
This is one of the most significant enhancements you can make to your
network this year!  You are now on the easy path to using versatile
client-server networks.

This new server and client software is part of a family of
IBM and Lotus products.  It will help you to quickly install and make
use of multi-functional, compatible servers.  These servers cover a
broad range of needs&#58;  from
an entry-level database server to a server
for comprehensive systems management of sophisticated networks.
Other technology at your fingertips enables you to quickly
begin to use your server on the Internet, doing guaranteed
transaction processing, workgroup functions with Lotus Notes,
and many other functions.

The IBM Software Server family of products
has been designed to satisfy your needs for:


Software servers that were designed to work together, thus
adding value to existing environments

A reliable environment on which to build business-critical solutions
with the performance and availability you require

Compatibility with all of the popular clients (such as Windows**,
Windows 95, Windows NT, Macintosh**, OS/2, and UNIX**)
and servers (such as Windows NT,
OS/2, Netware**, OS/400, AIX and other UNIX systems, and OS/390)

Built-in system services to enable mobile and remote users to securely
access and update your business data, regardless of where they are or
when they do it

Easy growth from the smallest departmental servers to the largest
systems of a modern enterprise

Comprehensive systems management that is easy to use and powerful
enough to look after workgroups and interconnected networks


When you combine the IBM Internet Connection Secure Server
with other software in this family
from IBM and Lotus, you get an integrated software environment that will
support your applications today and lay the foundation for your
applications in the future.  Other software suppliers
have built integrated solutions using members
of this IBM software family.
The information CD-ROM available with this product tells you
more about the integrated environments that are possible.

This book describes the Internet Connection Secure Server.
With these servers, you can host and
manage Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) home
pages and other documents to:

Distribute a wealth of information to the world, or
around your company, using text, high-quality graphics,
audio, and video
Publish presales or postsales product information that
you can revise easily and as often as you like
Create information that your audience can interact with
by electronic forms or e-mail
Dynamically track how your customers, suppliers, and
personnel use the information you publish--so you can
tell how well you're reaching the audience you want


In addition, the IBM Internet Connection Secure Server offers the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
protocol to make your business transactions secure.

Your server can be installed with currently supported
releases of OS/2.  OS/2 Warp Server is the preferred network
operating system base, providing simplified installation and the
most complete application server environment where
personal computer technology is deployed.
