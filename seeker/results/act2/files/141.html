RoboMedia - SUPER POWER TOUR 







. . . How robots help kids who hurt



Welcome to the Super Power Tour!







This page describes how Electronic Personality (EP) robots   interact with children in hospitals and other special care environments.  







Since 1986, the biggest use for EP robots has been teaching children in elementary schools.  The Million Dollar Machine Program (MDM) motivates children to care for their bodies, live healthy lives and achieve their personal best.  Please visit that site for extensive information on this successful program, now used by more than 2,200,000 children.

The Super Power Tour is for children who can not attend regular schools. There are more than four million American children in special care situations including physically and mentally challenged children, and children living in hospitals and rehabilitation centers.

If you haven�t yet experienced the magic of meeting one of our robots in person, please take a moment to read what professionals have to say about the Super Power Tour.  Their perspective will make the description below that much more meaningful.



This page answers three questions:



	What do robots do in hospitals?

	What is the Super Power Tour?

	How can I bring a robot to my facility?





We prepared this material especially for healing professionals and parents of children in special care.  We hope that many of you will have the opportunity to try robotic media with your children and to help us discover new applications.

What do robots do in hospitals?



Years ago, our robot was visiting patients in a Baltimore hospital.  One young girl had progeria, a disease that causes the body to age rapidly.  This 12 year old patient, with her perfectly normal 12 year old mind, was trapped in the wasting body of an 80 year old.  The staff expected her to die within weeks, which she knew.  As soon as she saw the robot, she became quick and sassy.  She and the robot had a great time joking, dancing and hugging.  We never forgot her smile, her laughter or our special friendship.  This program is the result.







We don't have a miracle cure for children�s bodies, but we do have powerful healing lessons for their minds.  And an amazingly effective way to teach. 

Children naturally project themselves onto EP robots; girls and boys, young and old, black, white, brown and yellow.  In the blink of an eye, a robot can become a child's personal buddy who's cheering just for them!  

A robot has another special quality In hospitals: it only projects love, hope, humor, and positive emotions.  A robot won�t change its expression or look away when it meets a burn victim.  A robot doesn't stare with pity or depression when meeting a child in chemotherapy who will die within a few months.  We use our robots to project love and strength.  

To tell jokes.  To accept the children as they are.  To inspire them to believe in themselves.  And to teach kids how to give life their best shot. 

While humans often look at life support systems and wheelchairs with apprehension, robots look with familiarity . . . or even envy!  They show children that these life-saving machines that make them so different are actually prized possessions.  Stuff to be proud of!  An EEG becomes child's personal video game.  And wheelchairs?  Over the years, our robots have conducted as many wheelchair races as the Special Olympics.  And the funny thing is, the kids always win 

. . . just by a hair!

We use robots to give children a fresh, positive look at themselves . . . taught with warmth and energy.  These high-tech characters are also high-touch.  They motivate with love and laughter.  And they engage children in a very different way from adults.  

The robot lessons always look at the brighter side of life and leave each children with lasting positive memories.  We use this rapport to teach children a special group of skills we call Super Powers.





What is the Super Power Tour?

The Super Power Tour is a traveling educational program that uses robots to teach coping techniques and self esteem skills to children in special care situations.  The program visits children's hospitals, family retreats, special camps, rehabilitation centers and other caring facilities.  The robot teachers empower kids to be more positive about themselves, even in the face of difficult circumstances.

The SPT program objectives are:



	to bring  joy and laughter to kids when they need it most

	to interrupt patterns of pain, loneliness and sadness that young patients fall into

	to teach practical skills that enable children to confront their challenges and improve their moods

	to demonstrate positive new views of difficult situations,

	to draw children out and engage them in productive communication

	to encourage healing children to seek each other out and interact in a constructive manner



Through careful lesson design, child care professionals found inherent 'Super Power' skills that every child can master.  There are five techniques in all.  Each power is a meaningful exercise that promotes a positive mental attitude.  

Easy exercises with muscle tone, breathing and smiling make a huge difference in energy and feelings.  The robot�s lessons in �Body Power� teach exactly that.  The power of words is called �Power Talk�.  Teaching a child something as simple as vocabulary control can make a big improvement in mood and perspective.  �Super Hand Power� helps children recall and bring back good moods by association with a physical movement.  �Super Vision� teaches children to make changes by using positive mental imagery.  Finally, �Super Questions� teaches children to change their focus and concentrate their thoughts on healing answers.

During each Super Power visit, an EP robot meets with children in small groups and also makes �house calls� to individual patient rooms.  Children receive Super Power Tour stickers and a comic book detailing all the powers to share with their parents and friends.
